## Introduction

This repository contains my solutions to algorithm problems on HackerRank. The solutions aim to be efficient, well-documented, and easy to understand. The challenges vary in difficulty, from easy to hard, and cover a range of topics like sorting, searching, dynamic programming, and more.

## Folder Structure

The repository is structured as follows:
📁 HackerRank/
│
├── 📁 Easy/
│ ├── solution1.ext
│ ├── solution2.ext
│ └── ...
│
├── 📁 Medium/
│ ├── solution1.ext
│ ├── solution2.ext
│ └── ...
│
├── 📁 Hard/

└── README.md


- **Easy/**: Contains solutions to easy-level problems.
- **Medium/**: Contains solutions to medium-level problems.
- **Hard/**: Contains solutions to hard-level problems.

Each folder contains files named according to the problem they solve. The `.ext` denotes the file extension of your programming language (e.g., `.py`, `.cpp`, `.java`, etc.).
